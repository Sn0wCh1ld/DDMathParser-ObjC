## Note from Sn0wCh1ld

This is absolutely not my project. This is a product of Dave DeLong. It was said by him [here](https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/659818621548400640) that this commit was most likely the final one using only Objective-C. I forked his repo and forced it to update to that commit in order to have a pure ObjC version of DDMathParser.
